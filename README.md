Provided skip list implementation is the most efficient out there in terms of memory and CPU
consumption. What makes it so good is a custom pointer system [originally described][pointer-system]
by Guillaume Plique.

```js
import { FixedSkipList } from "skipstruct";

let ascending = (a, b) => (a == b ? 0 : a < b ? -1 : a > b ? 1 : 0);

let capacity = 1000;

let values = [];
let byYear = new FixedSkipList(capacity, 1 / 2, (a, b) => {
  return ascending(values[a].year, values[b].year);
});
let byCountry = new FixedSkipList(capacity, 1 / 4, (a, b) => {
  return ascending(values[a].country, values[b].country);
});

function append(value) {
  let index = values.push(value) - 1;
  byYear.insert(index);
  byCountry.insert(index);
}

append({ year: 1939, country: "Italy" });
append({ year: 1926, country: "Germany" });
append({ year: 1899, country: "France" });
append({ year: 1913, country: "England" });
```

Iterating over skip lists going to provide indices of values in defined order:

```js
for (let index of byYear) {
  console.log(values[index].year);
}
// > 1899, 1913, 1926, 1939

for (let index of byCountry) {
  console.log(values[index].country);
}
// > England, France, Germany, Italy
```
